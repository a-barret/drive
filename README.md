# Overview

I am constantly trying to build my portfolio of projects that I have worked on as well as build my understanding of various programming languages.

This project is a typescript language-based project that runs in the command line interface. It is a vehicle management software where you can add a vehicle enter it's odometer and fuel levels to keep track of maintenance on the vehicle as well as overall efficiency.

I wrote this software to increase my understanding of the typescript language, as well as build a software that I have wanted to have personally to keep track of my own vehicle usage.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code as my text editor and I used Freeform for macOS to create some initial designs for the software.

I use the type script programming language and I used it's readline library.

# Future Work

- Create some calculations for fuel efficiency
- Add specific types of entries for the logbook that allow tracking of financial expenses
- Create a web based application to run the program in
- Allow the user to store their data in a file and/or on a server database.
